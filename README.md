Project Description:

This dataset contains a lot of historical sales data of a Brazilian top retailer



Basic Questions of every retailer: How much inventory should I carry?  Too much inventory means working capital costs, operational costs and a complex operation, lack of inventory leads to lost sales, unhappy customers and a damaged brand.

 

This is why short-term forecasting is so important in the retail and consumer goods industry.
